## Note

This app is currently under development and does **not** support music autoplay yet.

To use the app, you will need to provide your own **Spotify Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

You can obtain these by visiting [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)  
and creating a new application. Once created, your Client ID and Secret will be available in the app settings.

Optionally, you can also provide a **YouTube API Key** to enhance the appâ€™s functionality.  
While not required, it will improve the overall experience.
